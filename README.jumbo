These are the latest versions of the XV jumbo patches I originally created
in February 2000 (but never distributed) and eventually updated and released
in May 2004, prompted by a discussion on LWN (http://lwn.net/Articles/76391/).
Information about the patches, updates to the patches, and the patches
themselves can all be found here:

	http://freshmeat.net/projects/xvjumbopatches/

(Use the "Subscribe to new releases" link on the latter page if you want to
be notified of new versions automatically; trivial registration required.)

These two patches incorporate all of the fix- and enhancement-patches
available from John's XV site (http://www.trilon.com/xv/downloads.html
and ftp://ftp.trilon.com/pub/xv/patches/), plus a number of my own fixes
and additions, plus quite a few from other people--though not all of the
ones I'd intended to (sorry, SJT, AT, and JPD!) due to lack of time after
dealing with the latest security issue (which I discovered, sigh).  They're
still not fully complete, and it's possible they never will be, but I do
plan to continue working on them whenever the mood strikes--and I may even
release them publicly on rare occasions.  (At the current rate, it looks
like once a year may be the best we can hope for...we'll see.)

Also be aware that several other people have had the same idea over the
years.  Ones I've found, more or less by accident, include:

 - Landon Curt "chongo" Noll (http://www.isthe.com/chongo/)

 - Mark Ashley <mark@ibiblio.org>

 - <sudakyo@fat.coara.or.jp>
   http://www.coara.or.jp/~sudakyo/XV_jp.html

I very much doubt that this is an exhaustive list.  So far, most of the other
patch-sets appear not to be quite as extensive or as up-to-date as my own,
although the last three or four do include the [large] Japanese extension
patches that I omitted--not because they're unworthy, but simply because I
didn't find them until collisions between the two sets of patches had become
a large problem.  (Maybe for the next release...  I'd intended to try for
this release, but the security issues ended up taking almost all of my
available time.  And, to be honest, from my perspective, inclusion of the
jp-extension patches is more for completeness' sake than personal interest,
so their priority is fairly low.)

Below I summarize the component patches that are encompassed by my jumbo
bugfixes and jumbo enhancements patches.  Unfortunately, some of my own
additions never saw the light of day as standalone patches, but considering
the number of overlaps (collisions) already implicit in this list, it would
have been difficult to accomplish even if I'd had the time.  In any case,
they're present in these jumbo patches but not chongo's, so those who _really_
care can "subtract" the two sets of patches to see what I did.

Here's a quick guide to the "third-party" credits in the lists below:

  AAC = Andrey A. Chernov [ache]
        (http://cvsweb.freebsd.org/ports/graphics/xv/files/patch-ab)
  AD  = Andreas Dilger (adilger@clusterfs.com)
  AL  = Alexander Lehmann (lehmann@usa.net)
  AT  = Anthony Thyssen (http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/)
  DAC = David A. Clunie (http://www.dclunie.com/xv-pcd.html)
  EK  = Egmont Koblinger (egmont@users.sourceforge.net)
  GRR = Greg Roelofs (http://pobox.com/~newt/)
  GV  = Guido Vollbeding (http://sylvana.net/guido/)
  JCE = John C. Elliott (http://www.seasip.demon.co.uk/ZX/zxdload.html)
  JHB = John H. Bradley, of course (http://www.trilon.com/xv/)
  JPD = Jean-Pierre Demailly (http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~demailly/)
  JR  = John Rochester (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=2920)
        (also http://cvsweb.freebsd.org/ports/graphics/xv/files/patch-af, -ag)
  JZ  = Joe Zbiciak (http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/)

  SJT = TenThumbs (tenthumbs@cybernex.net)
  TA  = Tim Adye (http://hepwww.rl.ac.uk/Adye/xv-psnewstyle.html)

Other credits are as listed on the XV Downloads page or in the respective
patches (e.g., the jp-extension patches or within the PNG patch).

Finally, please note that these patches have not been blessed by John Bradley
in any way (although I copied him on the May 2004 announcement--no response).
Nor have I personally tested every change and feature!  (See the BIG SCARY
WARNING below for further caveats.)  In other words, they're both completely
unofficial and completely unguaranteed.  But they seem to work for me.  (And
when they don't, I fix 'em.  Eventually, anyway... ;-) )

One further "final" note:  this may well be the last release to include
separate fix- and enhancements-patches.  It is too much of a timesink to
maintain parallel trees--not to mention parallel makefiles (generic/public
vs. local/personal, old vs. new libjpeg/libtiff) and xv.h (unregistered/
public vs. registered/personal), particularly when some fixes come about
while working on an enhancement.  Henceforth--assuming, of course, that
there _is_ a "henceforth"--I expect to merge the patches into a single
jumbo patch.  (Alternatively, I may simply freeze the current fix-patch
and continue to evolve only the enhancements patch; in particular, new
fixes would appear only in it.  Either approach would be simple enough;
feedback as to which would be preferable is welcomed.)

GRR 20050410


How to build
------------

The following assumes you, the user, already have the libtiff,[1]
libjpeg,[2] libpng,[3] and zlib[4] libraries downloaded, patched (if
necessary), compiled, and installed, not to mention a C compiler and
the bzip2,[5] tar,[6] patch,[7] and make[8] utilities. You should also
have downloaded the original XV 3.10a source distribution from the XV
Downloads page[9] and be able to edit its Makefile and config.h files
as indicated in the INSTALL file. Finally, you should know what a
Unix(-style) command line is, where to find one, and how to wield it
with abandon (or at least with adult supervision)--and preferably not
as the root user until the make install step.  (A filesystem is a
terrible thing to waste.)

|  These patches work for Greg (and parts of them apparently work for     |
|  various other people), and so far Greg's CPU still computes and his    |
|  hard disks haven't been wiped.  But there's no guarantee that that     |
|  will be the case for you! In particular, not every incorporated patch  |
|  has been explicitly tested, nor has every possible subcase of the      |
|  explicitly tested subset. (Read that again; it's grammatical.) Nor are |
|  these patches officially blessed by John Bradley in any way. In other  |
|  words, if you use these patches, you do so at your own risk. (Greg     |
|  doesn't believe there are any serious problems remaining, but then,    |
|  what programmer ever does? Bugs happen.)                               |
|                                                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Assuming you have the prerequisites out of the way and aren't scared
off by the Big Scary Warning, here's the build procedure:

      bzip2 -dc xv-3.10a-jumbo-patches-20050410.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
      (or tar xvzf xv-3.10a-jumbo-patches-20050410.tar.gz) 

      tar xvzf xv-3.10a.tar.gz 

      cd xv-3.10a 

      patch -p1 < ../xv-3.10a-jumbo-fix-patch-20050410.txt 

      [optional] patch -p1 < ../xv-3.10a-jumbo-enh-patch-20050410.txt 

      edit Makefile and config.h as directed in INSTALL file (in particular,
      ensure paths to external libraries and header files are correct)

      make 

      ./xv your_favorite_image your_other_favorite_image etc. 

If everything seems to be working to your satisfaction, go ahead and install: 

      make -n install (and double-check that things will be installed
      where you want them to be)

      become root if necessary (e.g., type su)

      make install 

That wasn't so hard, was it?

not finished (and/or even started ;-) ):

 - fix xvpng.c not to use direct struct access
 - fix for never-ending pile of SLOW popups when viewing TIFFs with unknown tags
   (or truncated/corrupted images)
 - fix for minor .Z inefficiency in xv.c ("FIXME")
 - fix for filename entry-field mouse/cursor bogosity
   (want at least positioning to work; preferably also select/cut/paste)
 - fix for spacebar-for-next-image getting stuck at first text file
 - fix for .ppm.gz "disk leak" [can't reproduce...already fixed?]
   (maybe occurs only if filesystem is already nearly full?  bad .gz?)

 - transparency support for TIFF, XPM and TGA images
 - support for tiled background image (with transparent foreground image)
 - MNG/JNG support
